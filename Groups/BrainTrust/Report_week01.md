** Report: First Lecture on Pharo Programming **


** What I Did **    1. Installed Pharo according to the official tutorial.
                    2. Created a Pharo image and began acquiring a fundamental understanding of the language's syntax with ProfStef.
                    3. Followed the provided PDF lecture materials and accompanying videos to create a package, Counter class and methods.
                    4.Took initial steps to establish a GitHub repository.
										
** What I Did Not Do **: Initially, I faced difficulty comprehending the concept of "forking" a project. However, with the explanation in the class and supplementary video tutorials, I later achieved clarity on this topic.

** Difficulties I encountered and solutions **:
               Test Execution and Loading Issue: I encountered problems concerning the execution of tests and loading the project in the repository. I have effectively resolved them by revisiting YouTube tutorials and meticulously verifying the steps to ensure correctness.
       

** CHAMI Nour ** :

For the first lecture i would like to summarize the key takeaways from the session in 3 points : 
- A/ We learned about PHARO for OOP , We installed it and learned how to create in order ( packages=> classes => methods). we created a very basic example(a counter) and did several tests(increment, decrement).
- B/ I learned about using GIT and GITHUB , I knew them as concept before , however i never used them until now.
- C/ I faced some problems in my first interaction with Pharo and when trying to load my pharo project into my remote repository ( SSH and HTTPS related problems) , however after reading some PDFs i finally managed to upload it successfully.
